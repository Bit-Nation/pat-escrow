You can check if this contract is ready for a `withdrawal` by checking if the token
balance is greater or equal `uponAgreedTokens`. `withdrawled` must be false as well. 

You can check if the value has been drained by checking if the balance of the contract is not equal `uponAgreedEther`
and `withdrawled` is false.
